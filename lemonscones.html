<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk flour, sugar, lemon zest, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box grater.

Place in refrigerator or freezer as your mix the wet ingredients together.</li>
    <li>Whisk .5 C heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the blueberries, then mix together until everything appears moistened.</li>
    <li>Pour onto the counter and with <strong><em>floured hands</em></strong>, work dough into ball as best you can. If dough is too sticky, add a little bit of flour. If too dry, add 1-2 TBSP heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife, cut into 8 wedges.</li>
    <li>Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or after refrigerating in the next step.)</li>
    <li>Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheets.</li>
    <li>Bake for 22-25 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top. Remove from oven and cool for a few minutes before topping with lemon icing.</li>

<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>These scones are sweet, but feel free to increase to .5 C of granulated sugar for sweeter scones.</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze Before Baking:</strong>Freeze scone dough wedges on a plate or baking sheet for 1 hour. Once relatively frozen, you can layer them in a freezer-friendly bag or container. Bake from frozen, adding a few minutes to the bake time. Or thaw overnight, then bake as directed.</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze After Baking:</strong>Freeze the baked and cooled scones before topping them with icing. To thaw, leave out on the counter for a few hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm in the microwave for 30 seconds or on a baking sheet @300 degrees F for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Overnight Instructions:</strong>Prepare scones through Step 4. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Continue with receipe the following day.</li>
