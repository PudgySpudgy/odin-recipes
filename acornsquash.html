        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 acorn squash</li>
            <li>1 TBSP butter</li>
            <li>2 TBSP brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 TSP maple syrup</li>
            <li>dash of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat over to 400 degrees F</li>
            <li>Prepare the squash.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Microwave the squash for a minute each, to make it easier to cut.</li>
                    <li>Using a sharp chefs knife, carefully cut the squash in half, from tip to stem.</li>
                    <li>Use a sturdy metal spoon to scrape out the seeds and stringy bits inside each squash half, until the inside is smooth.</li>
                    <li>Score the insides of the squash halfs in a cross-hatch pattern, to about a half inch in depth.</li>
                    <li>Place the acorn halves cut side up in a roasting pan. Pour 1/4 inch water over the bottom of the pan so that the squash doesn't get dried out in the oven.</li>
                    </ol>
            <li>Rub a half TBSP of butter into the insides of each half. Sprinkle with a little salt if using unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Crumble 1 TBSP brown sugar into the center of each half and drizzle with a TSP of maple syrup.</li>
            <li>Bake at 400F for about 60-75 minutes, until the tops of the squash halves are nicely browned, and the squash flesh is very soft and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Once removed from oven, spoon brown sugar butter sauce over the squash.</li>        
                </ol>
